# RL_Project

RL project for the course "IA pour la robotique" at Sorbonne University

The main code comes from : "https://github.com/osigaud/Basic-Policy-Gradient-Labs", it is created by "Olivier Sigaud" a professor at Sorbonne University.

The objectif of this project is to have a scientific approach of the RL (Reinforcement Learning) methods and algorithms. 
Therefore, I explained and analysed the different environment (Cartpole and Moutain Cars), I made assumptions, I used the basic parameters,  I analysed the results, I deducted some improvements, and I repeated until I reached some good results.

However, the results obtain from the code can't achieved good results and in order to improve the result, I have implemented state of art algorithm of RL like DDPG,TD3, DQN and Rainbow.

For more explanations, There are the rapport : (Work in progress ... ) 

The code of DDPG and TD3 are from the github : https://github.com/sfujim/TD3


I made some changements/deletions in order to run with the code of my professor. Consequently, it is possible that not all the codes is working properly. Furthermore, if you want to test my professor code, you have to be aware that they all the functions are not available ( like n-step ) and there are fonctionality that I removed from my reposotory.
